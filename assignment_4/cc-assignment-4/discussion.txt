Word Count

1. Which steps in your program require communication and synchronization
   between your workers?

   The groupBy stage, where input data words are grouped for similar words needs communication between all the worker nodes, in order to shuffle the data to the relevant nodes.


2. What are bounding resources? Memory? CPU? Network? Disk?
   
   With larger input data, the same word count program will be bound by Network, due to the shuffle that needs to take place.

   Furthermore, it can also be blocked by Memory, if the input data is magnitudes larger than the available total memory in the cluser



K-Means Clustering

1. Which steps in your program require communication and synchronization
   between your workers?

   The initial centroid calculation has a 'distinct' function call. This defintely needs to communicate with other worker nodes to dedup the input data.

   While calculating the new centroids, a 'reduce' function call is made. This also needs communication accross worker nodes

   Once the new centroids are calculated, they are broadcasted to all the worker nodes. This too needs synchronization between worker nodes.


2. What are bounding resources? Memory? CPU? Network? Disk?
   
   In case 'k' is quite large, the program will be network bound, as these k centroids have to broadcasted at each iteration to all worker nodes.

   Similar behaviour will be observed in case 'k' and 'iterations' both have large values

   Higher values of 'k' and 'iteration' will also make the program CPU bound


3. Could you improve partitioning of your data to yield better results?
   
   As cell-id is used as the starting centroids, a pre-sorted input data according to the cell-id in this case can help improve performance.
